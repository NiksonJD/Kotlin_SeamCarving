This is the Seam Carving (Kotlin) project I made myself.

<b>Learning outcomes</b><br>
<p>You will learn how to work with images. At the same time you will get familiar with basic graph processing algorithms. Implement seam carving technique yourself and try it on any picture you like.

Seam carving is an image processing technique for content aware image resizing. Content aware means that it saves objects and object aspect ratio at processed image.

Seam Carving (Kotlin) is a graduate project.
